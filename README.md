## Considerations finalized
In this project I put into practice my knowledge with React, React Router Dom. I learned TypeScript in a practical and theoretical way, now understanding the difference between it and JavaScript. GraphQL is a very useful and innovative tool, I learned a way to make the API "typed", being it a strict typing, that is, we can't search for data that doesn't exist in the database and we can't register data that is not requested . This I can say that it was the first time I worked with TailwindCss, since it is a declarative CSS interface, that is, in the class itself we make the CSS declaration (it has positive and negative points and it is up to the developer), I consider it a practical tool and depending on the way it is implemented, I can maintain the code in a simple way.</br>
Last but not least, I want to express my sincere thanks to the CTO of Rocketseat <a href="https://github.com/diego3g" target="_blank">Diego Fernandes</a>, a very capable Dev and a great teacher, teaching in a practical and theoretical way several concepts, without him I certainly wouldn't have gotten this far with this application.
